# Ethiopian Medical Business Data Warehouse API

Welcome to the **Ethiopian Medical Business Data Warehouse API**. This module provides a RESTful API for managing and querying medical business data, built using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**.

## Features

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for medical business data.
- FastAPI autogenerated documentation.
- PostgreSQL database integration via SQLAlchemy.
- Error handling and input validation using Pydantic models.
- Environment-based configuration setup.
  
## Prerequisites

To run this module, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** (with a database set up)
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Pydantic**
- **Uvicorn** (for running the ASGI app)

You can install the necessary Python dependencies using the `requirements.txt` (if it exists):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

```bash
app/
├── main.py        # Entry point for the FastAPI application
├── crud.py        # Contains the CRUD logic for interacting with the database
├── models.py      # Defines SQLAlchemy models for the database tables
├── schemas.py     # Defines Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
├── database.py    # Configures the database connection using SQLAlchemy
├── config.py      # Loads environment variables for configuration
└── README.md      # This documentation file
```

## Setup and Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/medical-business-data-warehouse.git
    cd medical-business-data-warehouse/app
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    You can run the FastAPI app locally using **Uvicorn**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

4. **Access the API**:
    - The API will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
    - FastAPI autogenerated docs can be found at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

## API Endpoints

### 1. Root Endpoint

- **GET** `/`
    - Returns a welcome message.
    - **Response**: 
      ```json
      {
        "message": "Welcome to the Ethiopian Medical Business DataWarehouse API"
      }
      ```

### 2. CRUD Endpoints
Detailed CRUD operations (e.g., for medical data entities) are defined in `app/crud.py` and exposed in `app/main.py`. The specific endpoints might include:

- **POST** `/create` - Create a new record.
- **GET** `/read/{id}` - Fetch a record by ID.
- **PUT** `/update/{id}` - Update a record by ID.
- **DELETE** `/delete/{id}` - Delete a record by ID.

For a full list of endpoints and their descriptions, refer to the [FastAPI documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) generated automatically.

## Database Migrations

Ensure your database is set up before running migrations. You can integrate tools like **Alembic** for database migrations.

## Testing

You can write and run tests for the API using a framework like **pytest**. To run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
